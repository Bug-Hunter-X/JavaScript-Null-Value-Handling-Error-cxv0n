# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values. The `bug.js` file contains code with a flaw in null value handling. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  The core issue is the potential for unexpected results when null values are not explicitly checked for.

## Bug Description
The original code lacked proper checks for null inputs, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors in certain scenarios.  The improved version incorporates strict equality checks (`===`) to explicitly handle null values, resulting in more robust and predictable behavior.

## Solution
Explicitly checking for null values using `===` and returning an appropriate value (in this case, null) prevents unexpected behavior and ensures the function handles all possible input scenarios correctly.
